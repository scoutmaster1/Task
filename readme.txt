   10. Date Return Received
   11. Customer Rejected Shipment (Flag)
   12. Courier Company Lost Shipment (Flag)
   13. Returned Other Reason (Flag)
   14. Package Created By (User)
   15. Return Processed By (User)
    
User Action:
    1. User should be able to create a new shipment with the following parameters:
            a.Order Number
            b.Delivery Company (Drop Down)
            c.AWB (Unique check)
            d.Weight
            e.Package Value
    2. User should be able to delete a package from the list of packages
    3. User should be able to edit a package – all fields should be editable

View: 
   1 Landing page should have list of all shipment packages created
   2 Select a date and check all shipments shipped on a day
   3 Select all shipments returned in a given month
   4 Show average delivery days per delivery company – select by month
 

Evaluation:
    1. Accuracy
         a. We'll evaluate task coverage and desired results as mentioned in the task, along with end user experience.

         c. UI/UX Experience
    2. Performance
        a. Loading time, 
        b. API response time
        c. EXTRA CREDIT: Best optimization
    3. Code Quality
        a. We're looking for clear, easy to understand code.
        b. Write code that makes your thinking algorithm as obvious as possible.
        c. Prioritize readability over cleverness.
        d. We care less that you can code a solution to this problem in one line, and more that we are able to easily follow your code.
        e. Scalable and Extendable Code
    4. Time
        a.  Task should be completed in 4 hours.
        
        
Step 0:
       Create a Git Repo for the task and share the link for same by replying to our email drashtiscoutmaster@gmail.com, or you can keep the repo private and add scoutmaster1 as collaborator.
Step 1:
       Take backup of db used and commit the dump file along-with the code.
Step 2:
       Code should be in working condition when its pulled from repo to evaluate, add a .readme file for steps to setup the code if any specific requirements            needs to be downloaded
       

All the best and Happy Coding!
